:lock: Managing GitHub repos in a compliant way just got way easier.

One of the most common requirements for companies operating in regulated spaces is having consistent, enforceable repository configurations. Some teams have hacked together homegrown solutions, while others know it's something they need to do but never quite got to.

Our `aws-github-repository` component changes that by providing comprehensive GitHub repository management entirely through infrastructure as code.

**Manage repos and all settings declaratively:**
- Repository configuration (visibility, topics, features, merge settings)
- Environments with deployment protection and reviewers
- Variables and secrets pulling from AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store
- Branch protection rules and rule sets
- Webhooks, deploy keys, labels, and custom properties
- Team and user permissions

**Import existing repos and bring them under management:**
- Import existing repositories and their configurations
- Bring legacy repos under consistent management
- Maintain existing settings while adding compliance controls

**Define repository archetypes once:**
- Create abstract components for common configurations
- Use Atmos inheritance to automatically apply baseline compliance
- Every new repo inherits your security and compliance standards
- DRY up infrastructure with reusable templates

All powered by Atmos + a GitHub App for secure, auditable rollout across your organization.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Usage

**Stack Level**: Regional

This component provides comprehensive GitHub repository management with support for advanced features like environments, webhooks, deploy keys, custom properties, and more.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example for creating a basic repository:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    my-basic-repo:
      vars:
        enabled: true
        owner: "my-organization"
        repository:
          name: "my-basic-repo"
          description: "A basic repository with standard settings"
          homepage_url: "https://github.com/my-organization/my-basic-repo"
          visibility: "private"
          default_branch: "main"
          topics:
            - terraform
            - github
            - infrastructure
        teams:
          devops: admin
          developers: push
        variables:
          ENVIRONMENT: "production"
          REGION: "us-east-1"
        secrets:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "nacl:dGVzdC1hY2Nlc3Mta2V5LWlkCg=="
          DATABASE_URL: "ssm:///my-basic-repo/database-url"
```

## Advanced Usage with Atmos Inheritance and Imports

The component supports Atmos inheritance and imports to create DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) configurations. This allows you to define common settings once and reuse them across multiple repositories.

> [!TIP]
> For complete working examples of inheritance and imports, see the [`/examples`](./examples) folder in this repository.

### Creating Abstract Components

First, create abstract components that define common configurations:

```yaml
# catalog/github/repo/defaults.yaml
components:
  terraform:
    github/repo/defaults:
      metadata:
        component: github-repository
        type: abstract
      vars:
        enabled: true

        # Common team permissions
        teams:
          devops: admin

        # Default repository settings
        repository:
          homepage_url: "https://github.com/{{ .vars.owner }}/{{ .vars.repository.name }}"
          topics:
            - terraform
            - github
          default_branch: "main"
          visibility: "private"

          # Common features
          auto_init: true
          gitignore_template: "TeX"
          license_template: "GPL-3.0"

          # Merge settings
          allow_merge_commit: true
          allow_squash_merge: true
          allow_rebase_merge: true
          allow_auto_merge: true

          # Branch protection
          delete_branch_on_merge: true
          web_commit_signoff_required: true
```

### Creating a Master Defaults Component

Combine abstract components into a master defaults component:

```yaml
# catalog/github/defaults.yaml
import:
  - catalog/github/repo/*
  - catalog/github/environment/*
  - catalog/github/ruleset/*

components:
  terraform:
    github/defaults:
      metadata:
        type: abstract
        inherits:
          - github/repo/defaults
          - github/ruleset/branch-protection
          - github/environment/defaults
```

### Using Inheritance in Your Stacks

Now you can create repositories that inherit from these defaults:

```yaml
# orgs/mycompany/myteam.yaml
import:
  - ./_defaults
  - catalog/github/defaults

components:
  terraform:
    # Simple repository inheriting all defaults
    my-simple-app:
      metadata:
        component: github-repository
        inherits:
          - github/defaults
      vars:
        repository:
          name: my-simple-app
          description: "My simple application"
          topics:
            - application
            - nodejs

    # Repository with custom overrides
    my-custom-app:
      metadata:
        component: github-repository
        inherits:
          - github/defaults
      vars:
        repository:
          name: my-custom-app
          description: "My custom application"
          topics:
            - application
            - python
            - api
        # Override default team permissions
        teams:
          devops: admin
          backend: push
          frontend: push
        # Add custom variables and secrets
        variables:
          LANGUAGE: "python"
          FRAMEWORK: "fastapi"
        secrets:
          PYTHON_API_KEY: "asm://my-custom-app-api-key"
```



## Secrets and Variables Management

The component supports setting repository and environment secrets and variables.
Secrets and variables can be set using the following methods:
- Raw values (unencrypted string) (example: `my-secret-value`)
- AWS Secrets Manager (SM) (example: `asm://secret-name`)
- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (SSM) (example: `ssm:///my/secret/path`)

In addition to that secrets supports base64 encoded values [encrypted](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/encrypting-secrets-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
with [repository key](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/secrets?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-repository-public-key).
The value should be prefixed with `nacl:` (example: `nacl:dGVzdC12YWx1ZS0yCg==`).

### Environment-Specific Secrets and Variables

```yaml
environments:
  production:
    variables:
      ENVIRONMENT: "production"
      CLUSTER_NAME: "prod-cluster"
      LOG_LEVEL: "warn"
    secrets:
      PROD_DATABASE_URL: "ssm:///my-repo/prod/database-url"
      PROD_API_KEY: "asm://my-repo-prod-api-key"
      PROD_JWT_SECRET: "nacl:cHJvZC1qd3Qtc2VjcmV0Cg=="

  staging:
    variables:
      ENVIRONMENT: "staging"
      CLUSTER_NAME: "staging-cluster"
      LOG_LEVEL: "info"
    secrets:
      STAGING_DATABASE_URL: "ssm:///my-repo/staging/database-url"
      STAGING_API_KEY: "asm://my-repo-staging-api-key"
```

## Import Mode

The component supports importing existing repository and its configurations:
- collaborators
- variables
- environments
- environment variables
- labels
- custom properties values
- autolink references
- deploy keys

Import mode is enabled by setting `import` input variable to `true`.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    my-imported-repo:
      vars:
        enabled: true
        import: true
        owner: "my-organization"
        repository:
          name: "existing-repo-to-import"
```

The following configurations are not supported for import:
- secrets
- environment secrets
- branch protection policies
- rulesets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
